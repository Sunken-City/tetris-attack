Tetris Attack
=============

A game initially made for SCUSA's first annual hackathon using XNA.

This is a clone of Pokemon Puzzle Challenge for the GameBoy Color, which came out way back in 2000. I initially decided to remake this title not only because of how much fun I had with it as a kid, but also because I felt that the mechanics could be easily implemented within the short time span of a hackathon. The game has come out in multiple different variations on Nintendo consoles, but I picked this version because it was a personal favorite of mine.

The game at its current state is an implementation of the "Endless" game mode with score counting. However, there are quite a few things I'd really like to work on in the future.

The code is quite sloppy, as it was not only my first experience with XNA, but also was rushed by the hackathon's time constraints. It also isn't fully implemented, and lacks support for combos as well as the ability to lose. 

I'm looking forward to at least getting endless mode up and running, but it would be nice to add in the game's menu system and potentially an implementation of multiplayer.
